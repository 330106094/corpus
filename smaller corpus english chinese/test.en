i listen to the radio after dinner
i found it by chance
english is spoken by more people than any other language
the children were flying kites
is that better
that is our house
sir that cd is available only by special order
turtles are reptiles
i found her letter in the mailbox
what can tom do
how many books do you read per month
my parents live in the country
it is easy to read this book
he asked the man to help him
children should obey their parents
would you pass me the salt please
we will only consent on that condition
i will stay with tom until you get back
i am very concerned about his health
do you know why she could not come
i had a nice chat with her
a stitch in time saves nine
i was truly astonished
i am sorry to trouble you
tom came home early yesterday
where do the airport buses leave from
tom hugged mary
i cannot believe tom is really planning to do this
she is dieting
i got up early
may i have the check please
it is raining
this milk will not keep till tomorrow
i like children that is why i became a teacher
these shoes are too big for me
i am disappointed that i was not able to go with her
i want you to read this letter
it is no use arguing with her
i do not know her
his advice did not help much
she twisted her ankle while she was doing exercise
please take more care in the future
no one s going to find you
it is imperative for you to act at once
do not talk about it in my mother s presence
i had a feeling this might happen
this book is too difficult for you to read
thanks very much for having me to dinner the other night
i bought two loaves of bread
ask him his name
suppose you had a thousand dollars what would you do with it
you cannot go outside
release him
there are many hotels downtown
the students are talking about language and culture
i have got to go now
do not look at tom look at me
yours is over there
i wish i were young
tom s check bounced
i made him carry the suitcase
he is a dentist by profession
which team do you think will win
almost no one believes her
i can swim across the river
i do not want tom seeing this
he is at home today
what kind of woman do you think i am
my house has a small yard
it is ten o clock by my watch
people should do their best
he will make you eat dirt
the offer is too good to be turned down
he became an orphan when he was ten
what do you have the first period
does anyone here speak japanese
japan is a beautiful country
i will be very happy if i can serve you
he is as tall as his father
i want something cold to drink
her oldest daughter got married
i know that boy who is running
i gave careful consideration to the problem
someone stole my wallet on the train
she always gets her own way
i need more time
i missed the last train
they do not have to know
tom told the cops everything
why do not you eat vegetables
were you able to do it
he traveled all over the world
